## Summary

Jabb Bookclub is a full-stack application that allows users to create communities with bookclubs. These bookclubs are able to be made private or public, and have a booklist that keeps track of books read and their rating. 
Each bookclub also contains a discussion forum, allowing for comments and posts. Users also have their own book list, containing books that they can rate and leave reviews on.

## Technologies Used

- VueJS for the Frontend Javascript Framework
- Node and Express for Backend Framework
- RESTful API conventions in order to have consistent API naming conventions
- MongoDB for Database
- Auth0 for user authentication
- SCRUM Methodology for working with a team, implementing SCRUM's best practices.

## Team Involved 
Here were my amazing teammates that were involved in this application's development!
[Jared Carlson](https://github.com/jaredrcarlson/)

## What I learned
Learning the methods and key characteristics needed to perform well in a team, such as consistent communication and good group problem solving even when possible miscommunication is involved. We tried our best to abide to SCRUM best practices such as daily standups, and sprint planning over multiple days. 
Lastly, the scale that this project grew to allowed us to see how good project architecture allows for scalable code and how desired features later in development can require multiple changes in various parts of existing codes. This was a great experience, and really tested my full-stack abilities.
